**Stlr** is a fully extensible and type safe command console for Roblox developers.

- Great for admin commands, but does much more.
- Make commands that tie in specifically with your game systems.
- Intelligent autocompletion and instant validation.
- Run commands programmatically on behalf of the local user.
- Bind commands to user input.
- Secure: the client and server both validate input separately.
- Embedded commands: dynamically use the output of an inner command when running a command.
